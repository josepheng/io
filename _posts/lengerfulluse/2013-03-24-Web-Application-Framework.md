Last week, I was always busy with learning a new programming language [*Ruby*](www.ruby-lang.org) and was attracted by it's so much cool features. And of course, it's philosophy of design. It's aim to write a language for programmers, but not the computers. It's many global symbol system, it's fancy different but meaningful indicators for funtions. It's functional features like lambda and proc class. It combines a lot of features like *python*, *perl*, *shell*, *awk*, *Java*, *C\+\+* for instance.
Also, to see the power of ruby language, I try to construct a *ruby on rails* web application framework. Up to here, I come into contact with the conception of *web application framework*. I try to connect my previous knowledge about the web development related work with all the development tools I used before. Such as Spring Structs and Hibernate, Python web.py, including this, Ruby on rails.

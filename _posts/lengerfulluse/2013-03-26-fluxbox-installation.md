I have mentioned a little about the configuration process related to the lightweight *Desktop Environment* or some kind of full-functional *Window Managerment*. It's extremely a bit lucky that I could have encountered the 
**Fluxbox**. It's almost the same situation as my dating with Sabayon Linux. One day, I suddenly miss the lovely gentoo linux, so I open my 
google plus homepage, and search gentoo's current release news. It's definately amazing that the second result of the gentoo query term is 
about a lovely logo, which like some animal's foot surrounded by a circle. After search it in wikipedia, I found that it's 
the honey sweet foot of gentoo penguin. As for the Fluxbox, you couldn't imagine that it's almost the same situation. Let's start our 
narrative with the completion of Sabayon linux. I first choice the default Gnome Desktop envrionment, and everythins seems just work properly. 
However, when I tried to change the backgroud of the desktop theme, I found I cannot open the setting panel with the right click and selection 
of change desktop background item. After that some other symptoms continues one by one. For instance, There doesn't exist *System* menu in the 
Gnome default taskbar panel. and I cannot use the function of user system settings in my account applet.   So I decide to remove gnome and 
start something new, such as KDE or xfce4 *etc*. But at the same time, I found that it's not an easy thing to remove the gnome environment and 
install some new desktop environment due to some fuzzy and frustrating depencdency considerations. So I log out the Gnome and back to the GDM 
login manager to see whether there are some other Sessions for selection. Bla bla bla, Fluxbox has just been waiting for me. Great, It's You.  
#### Configure Fluxbox ####
The main confiugre file is under the user's Home directory, which is adopted a common configure style .fluxbox/. and it contains all aspect of 
the fluxbox, from the start application with fluxbox, to the menu item selection, windowmenu, keyboard shortcuts and background of the 
desktop.  I'll list below and give a detailed explanations.

The pain on the installation of FreeBSD system fonts during my college 
life still exists. It is still impressive that I was totally confused by 
the all series unttacked of the sytem fonts settings and the Chinese 
localized. I become suddenly hopeless.   
However, today, when I come back to re-learning the X window system 
settings by the Xorg tutorial, It suddenly become clear extremly. I just 
get the conclusion that systemic learning is thousand more important 
than the trivel experience, if we only consider the time and efficiency.  
#### the global logic clue in our brain ####  
The comprehensive understanding about somethings come with a global 
logic clue graphy in our brain. We get clear of the principal and the 
imporant process or steps to achieve the finally results. In the case of 
the complex or large system, we cannot grasp the whole, we need the 
inductive process, and gradually combined all the trivals understands 
to a whole entires.  In most time, We are accustomed to gain our 
knowledege from the whole to the detail parts, which is called 
deductive.
